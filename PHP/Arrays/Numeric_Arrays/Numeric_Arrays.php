<!-- You can have integers, strings, and other data types together in one array.
Example: -->

<?php

    $myArray[0] = "Jhon";
    $myArray[1] = "<strong>PHP</strong>";
    $myArray[2] = 21;

    echo "$myArray[0] is $myArray[2] and knows $myArray[1]"

    // outputs "Jhon si 21 and knows PHP"

?>
