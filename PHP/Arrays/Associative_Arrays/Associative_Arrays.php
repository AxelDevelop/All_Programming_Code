<!-- Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.
There are two ways to create an associative array: -->

$people = array("David"=>"27", "Amy"=>"21", "John"=>"42");
// or
$people['David'] = "27";
$people['Amy'] = "21";
$people['John'] = "42";

<!-- In the first example, note the use of the => signs in assigning values to the named keys. -->

<!-- Use the named keys to access the array's members.-->

<!-- echo $people['amy']; //Outputs 21 -->

<!-- Run the code and see how it works! -->
