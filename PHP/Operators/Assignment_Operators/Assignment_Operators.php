<!-- Assignment operators are used to write values to variables. -->

$num1 = 5;
$num2 = $num1;

<!-- $num1 and $num2 now contain the value of 5. -->

<!-- Assignments can also be used in conjunction with arithmetic operators. -->

<!-- the results are in an image called "Assignment" -->

<!-- Example: -->

<?php

    $x = 50;
    $x += 100;
    echo $x;

    // Outputs: 150
?>

<!-- Run the code and see how it works! -->
