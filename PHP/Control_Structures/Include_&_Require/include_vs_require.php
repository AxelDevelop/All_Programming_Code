<!-- The require statement is identical to include, the exception being that, upon failure, it produces a fatal error. -->

<!-- When a file is included using the include statement, but PHP is unable to find it, the script continues to execute. -->

<!-- In the case of require, the script will cease execution and produce an error. -->

<!-- Use require when the file is required for the application to run. -->

<!-- Use include when the file is not required. The application should continue, even when the file is not found. -->
