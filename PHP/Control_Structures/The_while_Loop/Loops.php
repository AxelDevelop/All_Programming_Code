<!-- When writing code, you may want the same block of code to run over and over again. Instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.

The while Loop -->

<!-- The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. -->
<!-- Syntax: -->

while (condition is true) {
   code to be executed;
}

<!-- If the condition never becomes false, the statement will continue to execute indefinitely. -->
