<!-- Conditional statements perform different actions for different decisions.
The if else statement is used to execute a certain code if a condition is true, and another code if the condition is false. -->

<!-- Syntax: -->

if (condition) {
   code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
   code to be executed if condition is false;
}

<!-- You can also use the if statement without the else statement, if you do not need to do anything, in case the condition is false. -->

<!-- The example below will output the greatest number of the two.
