<!-- The two methods for submitting forms are GET and POST.
Information sent from a form via the POST method is invisible to others, since all names and/or values are embedded within the body of the HTTP request. Also, there are no limits on the amount of information to be sent.
Moreover, POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input while uploading files to the server.
However, it is not possible to bookmark the page, as the submitted values are not visible.
POST is the preferred method for sending form data. -->
