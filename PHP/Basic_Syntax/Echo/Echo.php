<!-- PHP has a built-in "echo" function, which is used to output text. -->
<!-- In actuality, it's not a function; it's a language construct. As such, it does not require parentheses. -->

<!-- Let's output a text. -->

<?php

echo "I love PHP";

?>

<!-- The text should be in single or double quotation marks. -->
