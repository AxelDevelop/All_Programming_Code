<!-- Multi-line comments are used for composing comments that take more than a single line.

A multi-line comment begins with /* and ends with */. -->

<?php

    echo "<p> Hello World!";
    /*
    This is a multi-line comment block
    that spans over 
    multiple lines
    */
    echo "<p>I am learning PHP</p>";
    echo "<p>This is my first Program!</p>";
?>

<!-- Adding comments as you write your code is a good practice. It helps others understand your thinking and makes it easier for you to recall your thought processes when you refer to your code later on. -->
