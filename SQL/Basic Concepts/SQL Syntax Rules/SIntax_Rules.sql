-- A single SQL statement can be placed on one or more text lines. In addition, multiple SQL statements can be combined on a single text line.

-- White spaces and multiple lines are ignored in SQL.
-- For example, the following query is absolutely correct.

SELECT        City


FROM customers;

-- Combined with proper spacing and indenting, breaking up the commands into logical lines will make your SQL statements much easier to read and maintain.
