-- A primary key is a field in the table that uniquely identifies the table records.

-- The primary key's main features:
-- - It must contain a unique value for each row.
-- - It cannot contain NULL values.

-- For example, our table contains a record for each name in a phone book. The unique ID number would be a good choice for a primary key in the table, as there is always the chance for more than one person to have the same name.

-- - Tables are limited to ONE primary key each.
-- - The primary key's value must be different for each row.
