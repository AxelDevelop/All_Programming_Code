-- Once you understand what a database is, understanding SQL is easy. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

-- SQL is used to access and manipulate a database.
-- MySQL is a program that understands SQL.

-- SQL can:
-- - insert, update, or delete records in a database.
-- - create new databases, table, stored procedures, views.
-- - retrieve data from a database, etc.

-- SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, but there are different versions of the SQL language.
-- Most SQL database programs have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard, but all of them support the major commands.
