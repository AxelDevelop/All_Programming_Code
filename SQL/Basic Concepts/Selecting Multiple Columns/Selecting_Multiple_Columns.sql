-- As previously mentioned, the SQL SELECT statement retrieves records from tables in your SQL database.

-- You can select multiple table columns at once.
-- Just list the column names, separated by commas

SELECT Firstname, LastName, City 
FROM customers;

-- Results (the results are in the image called "results2")

-- Do not put a comma after the last column name.
