-- ORDER BY is used with SELECT to sort the returned data.

-- The following example sorts our customers table by the FirstName column.

SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY FirstName;

-- Results (the results are in the image called "Order_By_Example")

-- As you can see, the rows are ordered alphabetically by the FirstName column.
-- By default, the ORDER BY keyword sorts the results in ascending order.
